          Cancellation & Refund Policy Last updated on
          12-11-2024 13:47:41 POLMI SOFTWARE SERVICES
          TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED believes in helping
          its customers as far as possible, and has
          therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under
          this policy: • Cancellations will be considered
          only if the request is made immediately after
          placing the order. However, the cancellation
          request may not be entertained if the orders have
          been communicated to the vendors/merchants and
          they have initiated the process of shipping them.
          • POLMI SOFTWARE SERVICES TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE
          LIMITED does not accept cancellation requests for
          perishable items like flowers, eatables etc.
          However, refund/replacement can be made if the
          customer establishes that the quality of product
          delivered is not good. • In case of receipt of
          damaged or defective items please report the same
          to our Customer Service team. The request will,
          however, be entertained once the merchant has
          checked and determined the same at his own end.
          This should be reported within 7 Days days of
          receipt of the products. In case you feel that the
          product received is not as shown on the site or as
          per your expectations, you must bring it to the
          notice of our customer service within 7 Days days
          of receiving the product. The Customer Service
          Team after looking into your complaint will take
          an appropriate decision. • In case of complaints
          regarding products that come with a warranty from
          manufacturers, please refer the issue to them. In
          case of any Refunds approved by the POLMI SOFTWARE
          SERVICES TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED, it’ll take
          9-15 Days days for the refund to be processed to
          the end customer.

          If you decide to purchase a plan, it is important
          to understand that your subscription will
          automatically renew and you will be charged on a
          recurring basis until you choose to cancel your
          subscription. The cancellation may not take effect
          until the next billing cycle.
          <br />
          If you have set your subscription for auto-renewal
          at the end of each billing cycle, you can cancel
          it by adjusting your account settings. For users
          who make payments through third-party
          applications, the subscription can be cancelled by
          modifying the relevant options within those
          applications. Alternatively, you can reach out to
          our customer care team or send an email to
          support@nexify.club for assistance with cancelling
          your subscription. Once the company receives your
          email or request for cancellation, the
          auto-renewal feature will be deactivated
          accordingly.
          <br />
          Please note that even after cancellation, you will
          still have access to the service until the end of
          your current billing cycle.
